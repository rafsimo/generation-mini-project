## General info
Lunchapp was created as my mini-project when I attended Generation's Data Engineering Bootcamp. It runs on the command line, where it displays menu of options, takes input from user to navigate through the menu options. Information can be added, updated and removed - user can maintain a collection of products, couriers and orders.
When user exit the app, data is persisted using mySQL database.

## Technologies
  - Python 3.8
  - MySQL 8.0.23

## Setup

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
